# Extension
ks_engine allows the user to add its own
 implementation for the 
*kernel builder*, *kernel sorter*,
 *bucket builder* and *bucket sorter*.

This allows the heuristic to be more elastic
and more tunable on a specific problem without loosing generality.
It is also possible to define purpose specific methods that
allows to imporve both the efficiency and the effectivness of 
the heuristic.s
